⚡ ANDREIMIKH KERNEL LAB ⚡

No Hand-Holding, No Compromises, Just Raw Kernel Power

💀 What Is This?

This Repository Builds Performance-Focused OnePlus Kernels Integrated With Multiple KernelSU Eco-Systems

If You Want:

Full Root Control

SUSFS Power

Custom KSU Forks

Automated CI Builds

Clean Version Injection

Zero Bloated Non-Sense

You're In The Right Place

If You're Scared Of Fastboot, Go Back Now

🔥 Supported Root Engines

This Kernel Can Be Built With:

🟣 SukiSU-Ultra – SUSFS Monster Mode

🔵 ReSukiSU – Balanced and Refined

🟢 KernelSU-Next – Bleeding Edge

🟡 WildKSU – Experimental Fork

🔴 KernelSU (Official) – Clean Upstream

You Choose Your Weapon At Build Time

🧠 Core Philosophy

Performance > Safety Nets

Automation > Manual Mess

Power Users > Casual Flashers

Reproducible Builds > Telegram Prebuilts

No Mystery Binaries
No Hidden Patches
Everything Is Automated - Everything Is Visible

⚙️ Build System – No Weak Setup

This Repository Runs:

🚀 GitHub Actions CI Automation

🧩 Manifest-Based Source Pulling

🧮 Commit-Based Dynamic Version Injection

🛡 Auto-Detect SUSFS Header Parsing

🔧 Patch Injection (Official / Fallback Logic)

🧠 Modular Toggles:

SUSFS

ZRAM

LZ4KD

KSU META Switch

🧬 Kernel Versioning Logic

We Don’t Hardcode Lazy Version Numbers

KSU_VERSION=$(( $(git rev-list --count main) + OFFSET ))

Each KSU Fork Has Its Own Offset

Why?

So Versions Never Collide
So Managers Don’t Misread Builds
So the Ecosystem Stays Clean

🧨 What Makes These Builds Different?

✔ VMA Compatibility Fixes (When SUSFS Requires It)
✔ Proper Symbol Handling
✔ Clean Driver Injection
✔ KernelSU Full Name Formatting (ReSukiSU Compatible)
✔ ZRAM Enhancement Support
✔ LZ4KD Performance Compression
✔ Multi-Manifest Selectable Builds
✔ Zero Telegram-Only Patches

This Is Structured, Not Random Patch Stacking

🛠 Workflow Inputs

You Control Everything From GitHub Actions:
